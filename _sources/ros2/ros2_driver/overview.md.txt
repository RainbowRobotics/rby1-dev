# Overview

`rby1_ros2` is a unified ROS 2 driver package for controlling the Rainbow Robotics RBY1 robot.  
It wraps the RBY1 C++ SDK into a ROS 2 node, providing state monitoring and multiple control modes (Joint Position, Cartesian Position, Impedance, Gravity Compensation, and Trajectory Streaming) through a clean action/service/topic interface.

- **ROS 2 version**: Humble
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04
- **SDK compatibility**: rby1-sdk `0.10.x` and later

The system operates using two primary pipelines to interface with the robot:
1. **Direct Control Mode (`rby1_ros2_driver`)**: A standalone C++ ROS 2 node that communicates directly with the RBY1 robot or simulator via gRPC. User applications/scripts send standard ROS 2 topics, services, and actions (e.g. `robot_joint`, `robot_cartesian`) to command movements and monitor status.
2. **MoveIt 2 Integration (`rby1_hardware`)**: Bridges MoveIt 2 and `ros2_control` to the robot via a custom `RBY1SystemHardware` interface plugin. The hardware plugin streams command inputs to the robot via a direct gRPC connection, while querying status and coordinating power, servo states, and control rights with the `rby1_ros2_driver` node via internal ROS 2 service calls (like `/hardware_control`).
