If a <code>servo on</code> operation is performed when a joint is beyond its limit, the control manager state cannot be switched to <code>enabled</code>.<br> To resolve this:</p><ul><li>Set the joints slightly away from the limit using the physical brake release button while the power is off.</li><li>Once this adjustment is made, try the process again.</li><li>Additionally, open two log windows during this process to help identify which joint is causing the limit issue.</li></ul><blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ Make sure you are connected to the dashboard.

To perform arm commands simultaneously, it is recommended to use the <code>whole_body_command</code>. This allows you to send arm joint commands within the same stream command, enabling both arm and navigation control to work together.</p><hr><h3 id="q-what-happens-when-i-send-a-set-command-to-only-some-joints-while-the-rest-of-the-joints-continue-moving" tabindex="-1">Q: What happens when I send a set command to only some joints, while the rest of the joints continue moving? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-what-happens-when-i-send-a-set-command-to-only-some-joints-while-the-rest-of-the-joints-continue-moving" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: What happens when I send a set command to only some joints, while the rest of the joints continue moving?&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p><strong>A:</strong><br> If you send a new command to some joints while another command is already being executed, the new command will be handled according to its priority. There is no simultaneous execution of previous and new commands. If the new command has higher priority, the current position will be locked, and the controller will switch to the new command. If the priority is lower, the command will be refused.</p><p>Priority works on a scale from 0 to 100, where a higher number indicates higher priority. For example, if a command with priority 10 is running and a new command with priority 20 comes in, the previous command will stop, and the new one will start, triggering a controller switch.</p><hr><h3 id="q-what-is-the-difference-between-stream-and-send-once" tabindex="-1">Q: What is the difference between <code>stream</code> and <code>send_once</code>? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-what-is-the-difference-between-stream-and-send-once" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: What is the difference between \`stream\` and \`send_once\`?&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p><strong>A:</strong><br> The difference between <code>stream</code> and <code>send_once</code> is that <code>stream</code> is used for continuous data transmission, suitable when real-time trajectory input or ongoing feedback is required. It continuously sends commands or data.<br> In contrast, <code>send_once</code> is used to send a single command just once, typically for actions such as moving to a specific waypoint or sending a one-time instruction.</p><h3 id="q-what-is-the-meaning-of-send-command-get" tabindex="-1">Q: What is the meaning of <code>send_command().get()</code>? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-what-is-the-meaning-of-send-command-get" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: What is the meaning of \`send_command().get()\`?&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p><strong>A:</strong><br><code>send_command().get()</code> is used to send a command and wait until it is fully executed before returning. The <code>get()</code> function blocks the execution, ensuring that the command has been completed before proceeding with the next operation.</p><hr><h3 id="q-what-happens-when-a-stream-is-canceled" tabindex="-1">Q: What happens when a stream is canceled? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-what-happens-when-a-stream-is-canceled" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: What happens when a stream is canceled?&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p><strong>A:</strong><br> When a stream is canceled, the controller switch occurs, and the last encoder position is locked as the reference.</p><hr><h3 id="q-how-can-i-receive-sensor-feedback-while-in-a-stream" tabindex="-1">Q: How can I receive sensor feedback while in a stream? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-how-can-i-receive-sensor-feedback-while-in-a-stream" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: How can I receive sensor feedback while in a stream?&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p><strong>A:</strong><br> To receive sensor feedback in one request, you can use the <code>get_state()</code> function. However, if you need to continuously receive robot status, it is recommended to use <code>start_state_update</code> to receive data through the stream channel. This is similar to the command transmission method, where there are both once and stream channels for status reception.</p><p>For examples, you can refer to <code>examples/python/03_robot_state.py</code> and <code>examples/python/04_robot_state_stream.py</code>.</p><p>In summary:</p><ul><li><strong>Send Once</strong>: A one-time request-response structure similar to HTTP, where the client sends a request, and the server responds once.</li><li><strong>Stream</strong>: Allows continuous data transfer between the client and server, providing real-time updates.</li></ul><hr><h3 id="q-the-teleoperation-with-joint-mapping-example-is-not-running-what-could-be-the-cause-and-how-can-i-resolve-it" tabindex="-1">Q: The <code>teleoperation_with_joint_mapping</code> example is not running.
