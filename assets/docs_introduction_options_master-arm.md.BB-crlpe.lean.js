Sharing the same joint configuration as the RB-Y1, it allows both task-level and joint-level mapping for teleoperation. Scaled to about 65% of the RB-Y1, the Master Arm is designed for user convenience, making it suitable for operation in smaller environments.</p><figure style="text-align:center;"><img src="'+n+'" alt="Master Arm" style="width:80%;margin:auto;"></figure><p>With <strong>redundant degrees of freedom</strong>, the Master Arm can perform identical tasks in various postures. Additionally, a single button press lets users switch between <strong>torque control</strong> and <strong>position control</strong> modes. The robot&#39;s <strong>gravity compensation</strong> feature ensures smooth movements in torque control mode by negating external forces caused by its weight.</p><figure style="text-align:center;"><img src="'+a+'" alt="Master Arm Control" style="width:80%;margin:auto;"></figure><p>Mounted on a tripod, the system can be easily repositioned to control the robot from different perspectives and angles, providing flexibility in teleoperation setups.</p><figure style="text-align:center;"><img src="'+i+'" alt="Master Arm on Tripod" style="width:100%;margin:auto;"></figure><p>This robotic system also features an intuitive handle equipped with a <strong>trigger</strong> and a <strong>button</strong>. Pressing the <strong>button</strong> makes the robot follow the user&#39;s movements, and releasing the button engages a <strong>position lock</strong>, allowing precise control during teleoperation. The <strong>trigger</strong> is mapped to the gripper, making it easy to control.</p><figure style="text-align:center;"><img src="'+l+'" alt="Master Arm Handle with Trigger and Button" style="width:80%;margin:auto;"></figure><p>The tripod allows the <strong>Master Arm</strong> to be freely moved and repositioned.
