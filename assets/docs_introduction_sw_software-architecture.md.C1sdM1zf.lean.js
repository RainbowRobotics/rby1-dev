It operates alongside the application control PC (<strong>User PC</strong>) to offer scalability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Non-realtime communication channels</strong>: Designed for high-level commands and robot settings, such as power management. These channels use <strong>Google gRPC</strong>, allowing commands to be built using a <strong>builder pattern</strong> and executed at <strong>up to 100Hz</strong>. Two types of communication patterns are available:</p><ol><li><strong>Once</strong>: Suitable for executing a single command at a time, such as setting a target position or velocity. This method is used for one-time commands that do not require continuous updates.</li><li><strong>Stream</strong>: Designed for continuous command exchange, ideal for tasks where frequent updates are necessary. If you need to send and receive commands regularly, <strong>Stream</strong> mode is recommended for maintaining smooth operations.</li></ol><p>Available controllers include:</p><ul><li>Joint Position Control</li><li>Joint Velocity Control</li><li>Cartesian Control</li><li>Gravity Compensation Control</li><li>Optimal Control</li><li>Impedance Control</li><li>SE2 Velocity Control</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Realtime command channels</strong>: Focused on low-level, time-sensitive commands with responses at <strong>500Hz</strong> using <strong>UDP</strong>. While currently fixed at 500Hz, future updates will allow for variable frequencies. Users can implement their own position or torque controllers for real-time operations.</p></li><li><p>A <strong>robot model library</strong>: Provides access to the robot&#39;s kinematic and dynamic parameters, allowing users to build customized simulation environments.</p></li><li><p>Additional libraries support higher-level operations such as motion and task planning.</p></li></ul><h2 id="models" tabindex="-1">Models <a class="header-anchor" href="#models" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Models&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The SDK currently offers <strong>URDF</strong> and <strong>MJCF</strong> files, which allow users to perform simulations without physical hardware.
