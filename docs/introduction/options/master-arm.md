# Master Arm

The **Master Arm** is a fully active robotic system, where all joints can move independently, unlike passive devices. Sharing the same joint configuration as the RB-Y1, it allows both task-level and joint-level mapping for teleoperation. Scaled to about 65% of the RB-Y1, the Master Arm is designed for user convenience, making it suitable for operation in smaller environments.

With **redundant degrees of freedom**, the Master Arm can perform identical tasks in various postures. Additionally, a single button press lets users switch between **torque control** and **position control** modes. The robot's **gravity compensation** feature ensures smooth movements in torque control mode by negating external forces caused by its weight.

Mounted on a tripod, the system can be easily repositioned to control the robot from different perspectives and angles, providing flexibility in teleoperation setups.

This robotic system also features an intuitive handle equipped with a **trigger** and a **button**. Pressing the **button** makes the robot follow the user's movements, and releasing the button engages a **position lock**, allowing precise control during teleoperation. The **trigger** is mapped to the gripper, making it easy to control.

The tripod allows the **Master Arm** to be freely moved and repositioned. This design gives operators the flexibility to control the robot from various positions and perspectives. By adjusting the tripod's height and angle, users can set up the system optimally for their tasks.
